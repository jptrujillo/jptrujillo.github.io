Hello! I'm a postdoc working with Judith Holler in the Communication in Social Interaction (CoSI) group, based at the Donders Centre for Cognition and Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. My research has largely focused on using motion tracking to capture movement kinematics and their role in social communicative behavior, and in particular investigating how our intentions are revealed in the way we move.
Apart from research, I enjoy art (drawing and urban sketching, mostly), cats, and juggling my various sports-y activities (running, bouldering, martial arts).
As an in-between research and leisure, I also very much like solving problems in Python and making scripts do my bidding for me.

Current Research Interests
======
I'm currently working on using corpus data of natural face-to-face conversation to look at how people coordinate conversation using their hands, body, and face, along with speech, as well as how we adapt our visual behaviors to the demands of the current communicative environment.
